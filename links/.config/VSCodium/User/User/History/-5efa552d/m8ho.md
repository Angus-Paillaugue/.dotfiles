# Usage

To create magnificent tables, you don't have to use any custom component, just use the default markdown table like so :

```md
| Month    | Salary | Expenses |
| -------- | ------ | -------- |
| January  | $1450  | $1220    |
| February | $1640  | $1470    |
| March    | $1320  | $1200    |
```
## Result

And here is what it looks like :

| Month    | Salary | Expenses |
| -------- | ------ | -------- |
| January  | $1450  | $1220    |
| February | $1640  | $1470    |
| March    | $1320  | $1200    |

# Usage

To create magnificent tables, you don't have to use any custom component, just use the default markdown table like so :

```md
| Month    | Savings |
| -------- | ------- |
| January  | $250    |
| February | $80     |
| March    | $420    |
```
## Result

And here is what it looks like : 

| Month    | Savings |
| -------- | ------- |
| January  | $250    |
| February | $80     |
| March    | $420    |
